### Fork the repository

Fork the repository to you GitHub

### Clone your fork

Click on the code drop down menu. Now you can either download the zip file and extract it on your local system.

```
git clone https://github.com/Sanket1308/bots-collection.git
```

### Navigate to your local folder

Since the clone was downloaded into a subdirectory of your working directory, you can navigate to it using: cd NAME_OF_REPOSITORY.

```
cd Coding-questions
```

### Create a new branch

Use git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME to create a new branch and then immediately switch to it.

```
git checkout -b branch_name
```

Use git branch to show your local branches.

```
git branch
```

### Make changes in your local repository

Use a text editor or IDE to make the changes you planned to the files in your local repository. Because you checked out a branch in the previous step, any edits you make will only affect that branch.

### Git Add and Commit your changes

Use git add -A or git add . to stage your changes and git commit -m "DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES" to commit them.

```
git add .
git commit -m"<Description of changes>"
```

### Push your changes to your fork

When you are done making all of your changes, upload these changes to your fork using git push origin BRANCH_NAME.

```
git push origin <BRANCH_NAME>
```
